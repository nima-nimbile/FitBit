# FitFolio

## Project Description

I invite you to explore FitFolio, which serves as my portfolio, as well as a user-friendly platform with personalized recommendations and comprehensive nutrition information.
Fitfolio is a cutting-edge website designed to support Bootcamp attendees or similar programs in their fitness journeys. My primary goal is to help you avoid unnecessary weight gain while you focus on your intensive training program. With the power of the OpenAI API, I provide accurate and up-to-date nutrition information to guide you in making dietary choices.
